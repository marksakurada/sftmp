# Pattern Lab Starter

## Quick install and setup

Prerequisites: [node.js](http://nodejs.org), ruby.

Make sure you have these already installed; if not, run:

    npm install grunt-cli --global
    gem install bundler
    
After cloning and changing into that directory, run this to install dependencies:

    npm install
    bower install
    bundle install

You may have to run that again for updates; so it may be wise to save this: `npm install && bower install && bundler install`. **If you have any problems; this is the first thing to run.**


If you want to use this for another project and want to add it to a different git repo; simply run:

    rm -rf .git/


### Configuration

The main configuration file for the whole project is `Gruntconfig.json`; you'll find several important settings there, such as:

- directories and paths for scss, pattern lab, and javascript
- local server settings

`Gruntconfig.json` is commited with the project and shared between members of the team; however individuals can create a file called `Gruntconfig--custom.json` and override specific values there – that file is ignored by git so it can be customized per person (for example, some people like to set `openBrowserAtStart` to false).

There are many different pieces of tech and many files that set the preferences for each of them. Here's a list of them and where to find the config file for each.

- Compass/Sass: `config.rb` - [docs](http://compass-style.org/help/documentation/configuration-reference/)
- Bundler (Ruby Gem Versions): `Gemfile` - [docs](http://bundler.io)
- Pattern Lab: `pattern-lab/config/config.ini` - [docs](http://patternlab.io/docs/advanced-config-options.html)
- Grunt: `Gruntfile.js` and `package.json` - [docs](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks)
- Bower (library management): `bower.json` and `.bowerrc` - [docs](http://bower.io/)

## Conventions

- Relative links instead of root relative links for paths (where possible) i.e. use `../images/logo.png` instead of `/images/logo.png`
- All directory variables have trailing slash like this: `../path/to/dir/` - this allows us to set it to `./` and have it all be relative to Gruntfile
- Use camelCase for naming
- Use code comments todos on the same line or above issue like this: // @todo Example Todo Message
- Grunt plugins config object should have a comment to the docs URL

## Pattern Lab Terms

- **Atoms** are basic tags, such as form labels, inputs or buttons. They also include more abstract elements like color palettes, fonts, and animations.
- **Molecules** are groups of elements that function together as a unit. For example, a form label, search input, and button atom can combine them together to form a search form molecule.
- **Organisms** can consist of similar and/or disparate molecule types. For example, a masthead organism might consist of a logo, navigation, and search form, while a “product grid” organism might consist of the same product info molecule repeated over and over.
- **Templates** are comprised mostly of organisms combined together to form page-level objects. Templates mostly focus on content structure (such as character length, image size, etc) rather than the actual content.
- **Pages** are specific instances of templates and swap out placeholder content with real representative content.
